Here you will find a some questions and small issues that I found in my trajectory as a Linux user. Some of these questions/issues were recurrent and a bit specific (hence with a trick answer). To avoid searching multiple times for the same answer, I decided to list and organize them. The idea here is not to create a detailed documentation, but to provide hints to the solution of daily issues.

* [bash](bash.md)
* [disks](disks.md)
* [devices](devices.md)
* [environment](environment.md)
* [error](error)
* [vim](vim.md)

* [other](other.md)
