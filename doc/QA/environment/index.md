* Q: I created a keybind in `i3` that executes a bash script defined in `~/.bashrc`, but it does not work. Why?
* A: `i3` does not load `~./bashrc`. Thus, just call the script from the absolute path. See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50968451/bash-script-works-in-terminal-emulator-but-not-as-i3-keybind).

* Q: I do not use a display manager. After login in the console I have to type `startx` to see my graphical environment. How to automate this?
* A: 
    1. copy the file `/etc/skel/.bash_profile` to `$HOME/.profile`
    2. in the booting process, thi file is read after login and before starting the graphical environment
    3. in it add the following:
```
# startx after login
    if [[ -z "$DISPLAY" ]] && [[ $(tty) = /dev/tty1 ]]; then
        source startx
        logout
    fi
```
