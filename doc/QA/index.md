Here you will find a some questions and small issues that I found in my trajectory as a Linux user. Some of these questions/issues were recurrent and a bit specific (hence with a trick answer). To avoid searching multiple times for the same answer, I decided to list and organize them. The idea here is not to create a detailed documentation, but to provide hints towards the solution of daily issues.
