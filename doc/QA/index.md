Here you will find a some questions and small issues that I found in my trajectory as a Linux user and as
developer. Some of these questions/issues were recurrent and a bit specific (hence with a trick answer). To
avoid searching multiple times for the same answer, I decided to list and organize them. The idea here is not
to create a detailed documentation, but to provide hints towards the solution of daily issues.

* [bash](bash/index)
* [linux](linux/index)
* [vim](vim/index)
* [go](go/index)
