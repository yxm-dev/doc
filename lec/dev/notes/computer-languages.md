A machine consists of physical/electrical pieces called *hardwares*. The hardwares, themselves, are composed
by several electrical switches or other electrical components whose state change with the flow of an electric
current. 

The machine realize tasks following instructions. The instructions are about how to turn on and turn off the
several electrical switches/components of the hardwares. Because the switches/components has exactly two
states ("on" and "off"), the instructions can be abstractly represented using the numbers "0" and "1".

There are two major classes of programming languages: *interpreted languages* and *compiled languages*. 

* in an interpreted language the sentences are read line by line, giving the opportunity to interact the
  program during the process. Thus you may have different inputs from the user before providing the final
  output;
* in a compiled language the
